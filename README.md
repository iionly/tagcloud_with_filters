Work in progress...

Filter tagcloud entries to show only tags created / modified within a certain time (e.g. last 24 hours).

End goal is to add tabs to the tagcloud for different time periods (24-hours, 7-days, 1-month, All) to see what tags are trending.

Right now this end goal has not yet been reached. Version alpha-.1 has no tabs / no filters yet. Right now it's more for testing and the tags displayed in the tagcloud include only the tags created / modified within the last 24 hours.
